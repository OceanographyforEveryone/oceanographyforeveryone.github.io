## The ocean belongs to everyone.

![Oceanography for Everyone logo](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/oceanographyforeveryone.github.io/blob/master/OfE_sticker2.jpg)

The tools necessary to study, explore, and understand the ocean are often inaccessible to the vast majority of ocean users. By nurturing a community of open-source hardware developers, scientists, and ocean stakeholders, we want to change that.

Whether you’re a researcher looking for alternatives to expensive scientific equipment, a citizen scientist interested in building a marine monitoring program, a fisherman exploring new tools to understand their catch, or an ocean enthusiast seeking new ways to interact with the sea, this community is for you.

Under each project, you will find links to resources, build guides, 3D-printer files, code repositories; everything you need to build your own tools to study the ocean. 

The ocean belongs to all of us. Let’s ensure that everyone has access to the tools needed to understand it.

### Meet the OpenCTD

![NEED A BETTER PICTURE HERE]()

The OpenCTD is a low-cost, open-source CTD designed for ocean stakholders working in coastal marine environments, where entire research and monitorring projects can be conducted for less than the cost of a commercial CTD. It was developed by a core team of marine ecologists in collaboration with a distributed community of scientists, engineers, makers, and conservation practitioners. It is assembled from components commonly available at large hardware stores or through major online retailers.

### How You Can Help

**GitHub.** We use GitHub to host our various projects. GitHub can seem a bit daunting to people who aren’t familiar with it. At its core, GitHub is a tool to organize files, coordinate files, and maintain version control (multiple people can edit the same file, while keeping everything in sync). [GitHub has compiled a set of useful guides to help you get started](https://guides.github.com/).

**Getting started.** Projects are organized into repositories (‘repos’) that contain the source code, supporting documents, data files, and other materials needed for each project. When you visit a repo, check the README.md, this will describe the project (including the current status), contain necessary guides, and let you know how to help.

**Issues and feature requests.** If you see a problem or have an idea for how something can be improved, raise an issue. The “issue” tab can be found at the far right corner of each repo, under the “code” tab. An issue can be as small as a typo or as big as an entirely new project. [Here is an example of the issue we raised when we realized that the site would benefit from detailed build instructions](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/issues/5).

**Pull requests.** When you are ready to make contributions to the projects, send a pull request. A pull requests creates a new copy of the project files that you can edit. When you’re happy with the changes you’ve made “commit” them to the repo. Don’t worry about breaking anything, commits have to be reviewed before they are added to the master file.
